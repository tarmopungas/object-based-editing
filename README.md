# object-based-editing
Chatbot-based program that detects various objects in a photo and allows to manipulate those objects (in Estonian).
The program is set up to be used in Google Colaboratory, but can be repurposed to be used locally with little trouble.
Before running, you also need to add [this model (click to download)](https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/essentials-v5/resnet50_coco_best_v2.1.0.h5/) to the working directory.
